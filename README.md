What did I do?
- I created a DB for a bookstore with tables about books, authors, publishers and store locations - as well as stock levels. I combined my tables into a view that highlighted stock levels. I based my view on the stock table, using inner joins to bring in the data from all other tables in place of the table IDs as foreign keys. 
- I created a function and stored procedure to help check stock levels

I created my DB after 16 hours of taught sessions, and presented to the rest of the cohort.
